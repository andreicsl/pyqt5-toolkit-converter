# Weight & Length Unit Converter + BMI Calculator (PyQt5 GUI)

A simple and intuitive desktop application built using **Python** and **PyQt5** that allows users to:

- Convert **weight units**: kilograms (kg), grams (g), pounds (lbs), ounces (oz)
- Convert **length units**: centimeters (cm), meters (m), kilometers (km), inches (in), feet (ft)
- Calculate **Body Mass Index (BMI)** with easy input fields

This project showcases GUI development using **PyQt5 Designer** and Python logic integration.
